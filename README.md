## JiraToolsKit

#### Description 

JiraToolsKit is a macOS framework (written in swift) to communicate with the JIRA API. The command line [jiratools](https://github.com/lottadot/jiratools) uses the JiraToolsKit framework to communicate with JIRA. The framework is small and lightweight. It is in no way meant to be 100% **complete** towards the `JIRA` API - their API is **huge** - pull requests appreciated :)


##### How To use this?

Use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

##### Trial Jira Instance

If you would like to try this but are hesitant to run it against your production `JIRA` instance, you can run a local development instance of `Jira` fairly easily. Follow the directions in the [JiraLottadotTools](https://github.com/lottadot/JiraLottadotTools) project.
